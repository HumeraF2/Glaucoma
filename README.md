Convolutional neural network for automatic glaucoma assessment using a fusion framework for severity levels
This study proposes to use a CNN to detect the presence of glaucoma and classify the severity levels using a combination of fundus and OCT images of the same eye images.  The advantage of using a CNN is that is that it automates the process and can extract critical features at all levels.  Two CNNs are used, the first for OCT images for detecting glaucoma and the second CNN for fundus images for classifying the severity levels.
